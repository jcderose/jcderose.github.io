            <div class="content">
                <p>I'm an independent FinOps advisor who empowers companies to understand and manage their public cloud spend. Combining industry research with a decade of experience building digital transformation programs, I help my clients leverage cloud spend data to make data-driven business decisions.</p>
                <p>My consulting mindset enables me to work with multiple organizations and vendors at various levels of project management maturity, and build strong working relationships with senior leaders and engineers across functions and departments. My deep familiarity with software and business development processes enables me to effectively manage complex cross-functional projects.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I create educational content with the FinOps Foundation to help companies start their FinOps journeys, and volunteer in my local community.</p>
