            <div class="content">
                <p>10 years building digital transformation programs across IT, DevOps, and FinOps taught me that lasting success stems from people, not from technology. My programs are successful because they align people, processes, and technology to accomplish quick-wins and create sustainable long-term change.</p>
                <p>My consulting mindset enables me to work with multiple organizations and vendors at various levels of project management maturity, and build strong working relationships with senior leaders and engineers across functions and departments. My deep familiarity with software and business development processes enables me to effectively manage complex cross-functional projects.</p>
